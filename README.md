# LambdaCalculus

Final project for the Fall 2023 class CSCI 3434: Theory of Computation. Worked with a group to create a presentation on the basics of lambda calculus, its history, and its use in modern functional programming languages. Additionally, an individual paper was submitted by each group member.
